Recursion is a powerful programming concept in which a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. It offers an elegant way to handle tasks that can be naturally subdivided into similar, but smaller, instances of the same problem. In C++ and many other programming languages, recursive functions are defined by their ability to terminate based on a base case, preventing infinite loops. Recursion is commonly used for tasks like searching, sorting, and navigating complex data structures. While it can lead to concise and elegant solutions, it requires careful consideration of base cases and stack management to prevent stack overflow errors. Understanding recursion is a valuable skill for writing efficient and elegant code.
